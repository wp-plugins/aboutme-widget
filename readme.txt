Add an instant about section to your blog by importing your about.me page.

== Description ==

Set your blog up right with an About section instantly pulled from your about.me page.

= Automatic =
Your blog is immediately populated with a photo, biography and links to all your social networks. As your about.me page is updated, so is your about.me widget on your WordPress blog.

= Social = 
Readers can easily connect where you are online via the social icons included in the widget. Increase friends and followers and show off your online presence.

= Customize = 
Set the name of the section (About the Author, Who I Am etc.), change the size of your name, and choose which elements of your about.me page to display! 

= Visual = 
Bring in the beautiful background from your about.me page, as well as the visual icons from your social networks.

== Installation ==

Quickly get the about.me widget working on your blog:

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to **Appearance >> Widgets** to move the widget into your theme and configure the name and settings.

= Embed in a Post =
You can embed your about.me page in a post instead of adding it to your theme. To do so:

1. Install and activate the about.me widget as described above, but do not move the widget into your theme.
2. Add the following shortcode to your post, substituting your own about.me username:

   [aboutme username="user_name"]

Your about.me page will be embedded in the post with your background image, name, bio, and icons for your social networks.

Note: Embedding in a post is in Beta testing.
